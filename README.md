# Time_Series_Forecasting-Predicting_Stock_Prices_using_an_LSTM_model

Aim of this project was to build a multi-layer LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) recurrent neural network to predict the last value of a sequence of values, i.e., the TESLA stock price.

***Modules needed: Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Math.***

This repository contains the following files:
1. **Code**
   - Time Series Forecasting - Predicting TESLA Stock Prices using an LSTM model.ipynb
2. **Dataset**
   - TESLA.csv  
          (This file contains TESLA stock price data from 30/06/2011 to 30/06/2021.)  
3. **README** 

Thanks to Yahoo finance, I got the data for free. Use the following link to get the stock price history of TESLA:
